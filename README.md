## USACO

### Organization

Here is where I keep all my solutions to [USACO](http://usaco.org/) problems broken down by division ([Bronze](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Bronze), [Silver](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Silver), [Gold](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Gold), [Platinum](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Platinum))
The folder [implementations](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Implementations) has ready to use code for thing like BIT and DSU.
[Training](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Training) has useful resources, some [USACO training](https://train.usaco.org/) code, and subrepositories of classes I took to impove my coding skills.

### About

I have been training for [USACO](http://usaco.org/) since the summer of 7th grade. I took classes in [Alphastar](https://alphastar.academy/) and [Starleague](https://starleague.us/). My goal is to pass [USACO](http://usaco.org/) Platinum. So far I passed the Bronze and Silver division in December 2020.

In April 2022, I hosted the USACO director, Dr. Brian Dean, in a Q&A facilitated by Storming Robots and the [USACO-Group](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md)! Read more about that using [this link](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md#hosting-dr-dean) to the [Storming Robots repos](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots) [USACO-Group.md](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots/blob/master/USACO-Group.md#hosting-dr-dean) file.

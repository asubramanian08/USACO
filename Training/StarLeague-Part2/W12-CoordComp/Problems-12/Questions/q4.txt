Grazing Area (Starleague Training Problem)
Farmer John's farm is divided into an N x M unit square grid of pastures (1 <=N, M <= 10^6). K (0 <= K <= 1000) 
of the horizontal or vertical strip of pastures contain rocks. Cows cannot graze in a rocky pasture and cannot 
pass through it. 

Every morning cows start grazing in the first grid pasture (1, 1). What is the total grazing area for the cows 
in the farm? Of course, the cows only move horizontally or vertically on the X or Y axis, they never go 
diagonally.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N, M and K
Line 2 to K+1: Four integers, x1, y1, x2, y2 (x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2): Coordinates of the two end pastures of a 
rocky strip of pastures.

OUTPUT FORMAT 
Number of pastures cows can graze.

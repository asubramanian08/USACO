Sleepwalking Cows 2 (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John's (FJ) N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows are sleeping in M (1 <= M <= 1,000,000,000) stalls. Cows and stalls 
are conveniently numbered  1 ... N and 1 ... M. Stalls are located side by side.

Farmer John knows in which barn each cow is asleep. Some stalls can be empty and some stalls may contain several 
cows. But the cows start to wander at night and go to other stalls. FJ needs to track the total number of cows 
in a range of stalls to organize the night feeding. Help FJ to determine if total number of cows in a range of 
stalls exceeds X in any time when the movements of the cows are known.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N, M, K and X. K is total number of movements and queries.
Line 2: N space separated integers x. xi denotes the stall ID where cowi was asleep.
Line 3 to K+2: For updates 0 a b: cow a moves to stall b from its current stall. For queries 1 a b: Print total 
number of cows between the stall a and stall b if the sum > X, a and b both are inclusive.

OUTPUT FORMAT
An integer for each query if the sum > X.

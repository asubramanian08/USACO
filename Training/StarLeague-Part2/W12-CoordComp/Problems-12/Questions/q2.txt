Square Overlap (USACO 2013 January, Silver)
Farmer John is planning to build N (2 <= N <= 50,000) square fenced-in pastures on his farm, each of size exactly 
K x K (1 <= K <= 1,000,000). Pasture i is centered at point (x_i, y_i) with integer coordinates in the range 
-1,000,000...1,000,000.  However, in his haste to complete his plans, FJ realizes that he may have accidentally 
placed two pastures in locations that overlap (by overlap, this means the two pastures share a positive area in 
common).  No two pastures share the exact same center point.

Given the locations of each of the planned square pastures, please help FJ compute the area shared by the two 
overlapping pastures.  Output zero if no two squares overlap, and -1 if overlap occurs between more than a single 
pair of pastures.  

PROBLEM NAME: squares

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.  K is guaranteed to be even.
* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integers x_i and y_i, describing the center of the ith pasture.

SAMPLE INPUT (file squares.in):
4 6
0 0
8 4
-2 1
0 7

INPUT DETAILS:
There are 4 squares, each of size 6 x 6.  The first square is centered at (0,0), and so on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: The area shared by the two overlapping squares.  Output zero if no two squares overlap, and -1 if 
overlap occurs between more than a single pair of pastures.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file squares.out):
20

OUTPUT DETAILS:
Pastures #1 and #3 overlap in 20 units of area.

PS: This problem can be solved with sweep line and coordinate compression techniques. Make both solutions.

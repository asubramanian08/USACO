Load Balancing (USACO 2016 February, Silver)

Farmer John's N cows are each standing at distinct locations (x1,y1)…(xn,yn) on his two-dimensional farm 
(1≤N≤1000, and the xi's and yi's are positive odd integers of size at most 1,000,000). FJ wants to partition his 
field by building a long (effectively infinite-length) north-south fence with equation x=a (a will be an even 
integer, thus ensuring that he does not build the fence through the position of any cow). He also wants to build 
a long (effectively infinite-length) east-west fence with equation y=b, where b is an even integer. These two 
fences cross at the point (a,b), and together they partition his field into four regions.

FJ wants to choose a and b so that the cows appearing in the four resulting regions are reasonably "balanced", 
with no region containing too many cows. Letting M be the maximum number of cows appearing in one of the four 
regions, FJ wants to make M as small as possible. Please help him determine this smallest possible value for M.

INPUT FORMAT (file balancing.in):
The first line of the input contains a single integer, N. The next N lines each contain the location of a single 
cow, specifying its x and y coordinates.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file balancing.out):
You should output the smallest possible value of M that FJ can achieve by positioning his fences optimally.

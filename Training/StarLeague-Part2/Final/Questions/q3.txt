Symmetry (USACO 2012 February Contest, Gold Division)

After taking a modern art class, Farmer John has become interested in finding geometric patterns in everything 
around his farm.  He carefully plots the locations of his N cows (2 <= N <= 1000), each one occupying a distinct 
point in the 2D plane, and he wonders how many different lines of symmetry exist for this set of points.  A line 
of symmetry, of course, is a line across which the points on both sides are mirror images of each-other.  

Please help FJ answer this most pressing geometric question.

PROBLEM NAME: symmetry

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: The single integer N.
* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers representing the x and y coordinates of the ith 
cow (-10,000 <= x,y <= 10,000).

SAMPLE INPUT (file symmetry.in):
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1

INPUT DETAILS:
The 4 cows form the corners of a square.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: The number of different lines of symmetry of the point set.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file symmetry.out):
4

OUTPUT DETAILS:
There are 4 lines of symmetry -- one vertical, one horizontal, and two diagonal.

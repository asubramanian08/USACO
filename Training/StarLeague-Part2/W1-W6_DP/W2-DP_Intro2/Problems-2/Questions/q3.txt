Fence Painting (Starleague Training Problem)

After several seasons of hot summers and harsh winters, Farmer John decided to repaint the fence in the farm. The 
length of the fence is L (1 <= L <= 10,000) meters.

Cows are eager to help with the painting job for a small fee. But the way they calculate the fee is a bit 
complicated. They demand ki (1 <= ki <= 1000) hay bales to paint di (1 <= di <= L) meters of the fence. They make 
N (1 <= N <= L) such offers.

What is the minimum number of bales FJ has to give to paint the entire fence without painting the same place more 
than once?

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: L an N
Line 2 ... N+1; Each line contains two integers di and ki. 

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer denoting minimum number of hay bales FJ needs to pay. Print -1 if it is not possible to paint 
the entire fence.

SAMPLE INPUT (file fencepaint.in)
10 5
2 5
3 12
5 20
6 10
10 50

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file fencepaint.out)
20

OUTPUT DETAILS
2 + 2 + 6 = 10 meters. Total price is 5 + 5 + 10 = 20 hay bales.

Cow Tower (Starleague Training Problem)

Although a little known fact, cows can climb over each other to form towers. Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 10,000) 
cows explore the weeds around by building towers in this way. 

At the bottom there is a single cow, above that another cow, and so on. In order for the tower to survive, each 
cow must be strong enough to bear its own weight and the weight of all cows above it. Each cow has its own weight 
wi ( 1=< wi <= 10,000) and total weight ti (1 <= ti <= 1,000,000) she can carry.

Help the cows calculate the maximum number of cows in a tower.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N
Line 2 ... N_1: Each line contains two integers wi and ti.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer denoting maximum number of cows in a tower.

Lilypad Pond (USACO 2007 Feb, Gold)

FJ has installed a beautiful pond for his cows' esthetic enjoyment and exercise. The rectangular pond has been 
partitioned into square cells of M rows and N columns (1 <= M <= 30; 1 <= N <= 30). Some of the cells have 
astonishingly sturdy lilypads; others have rocks; the remainder are just beautiful, cool, blue water.

Bessie is practicing her ballet moves by jumping from one lilypad to another and is currently located at one of the 
lilypads. She wants to travel to another lilypad in the pond by jumping from one lilypad to another. Surprising 
only to the unitiated, Bessie's jumps between lilypads always appear as a chess-knight's move: one move in one 
direction and then two more in the orthogonal direction (or perhaps two in one direction and then one in the 
orthogonal direction).

Farmer John is observing Bessie's ballet drill and realizes that sometimes she might not be able to jump to her 
destination lilypad because intermediary lilypads are missing. Ever thrifty, he wants to place additional lilypads 
so she can complete her quest (perhaps quickly, perhaps by using a large number of intermediate lilypads). Of 
course, lilypads cannot be placed where rocks already intrude on a cell.

Help Farmer John determine the minimum number of additional lilypads he has to place, and in how many ways he can 
place that minimum number.

PROBLEM NAME: lilypad

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: M and N
* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes row i of the pond using N  space-separated integers with these values: 0 
indicates empty water; 1 indicates a lilypad in place; 2 indicates rock in place; 3 indicates the lilypad Bessie 
starts on; 4 indicates the lilypad Bessie wants to travel to.

SAMPLE INPUT (file lilypad.in):
4 5
1 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 4 0

INPUT DETAILS:
The ponds has 4 rows and 5 columns. Bessie is at row 2 column 1, and she wants to reach row 4 column 4. A rock and 
three lilypads are present.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: One integer: the minimum number of additional lilypads required. If it is not possible to help Bessie 
jump to her destination, print -1.
* Line 2: One integer: the total number of possible ways the additional lilypads can be positioned.  This number is 
guaranteed to fit into a single 64-bit signed integer.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file lilypad.out):
2
3

OUTPUT DETAILS:
Two lilypads are required. There are three ways to place them: row 4 column 2 and row 2 column 3; row 1 column 3 
and row 3 column 2; or row 1 column 3 and row 2 column 5:

          R1C2,R2C3     R1C3,R3C2     R1C3,R2C5
          1 0 0 0 0     1 0 X 0 0     1 0 X 0 0
          3 0 X 0 0     3 0 0 0 0     3 0 0 0 X

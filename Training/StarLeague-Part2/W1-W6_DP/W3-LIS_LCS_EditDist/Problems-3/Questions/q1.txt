Hay Bale Tower (Starleague Training Problem)

Although stacking hay bales is a routine job on the farm, it is a difficult task. Because the height, depth and 
width of hay bales can be different.

Farmer John wants to make a tallest hay bale tower, so that his cows cannot mooch any of the hay bales. FJ start 
with a single hay bale and place next hay bale on top of the previous one. At the end, a tower is formed with one 
hay bale in each level.

In order for the tower to be as robust as possible, he can only place a hay bale on top of another one if the 
dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower hay bale are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the 
higher one. FJ can rotate a hay bale so that any side functions as its base and there are an infinite number of 
hay bale of each size. 

Help FJ calculate height of the tallest tower.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: An integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting  number of different size of hay bales.
Line 2..N+1: Three integers wi, di, hi (1 <= wi, di, hi <= 1000) as width height and depth of a hay bale. 

OUTPUT FORMAT 
A single integer that is the height of the tallest tower.

SAMPLE INPUT (file baletower.in)
4 
4 6 7 
1 2 3  
4 5 6 
10 12 32 

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file baletower.out)
60 
 
OUTPUT DETAILS
The height 60 is obtained by boxes {wi, di, hi}: {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {4, 5, 6}, {5, 6, 4}, {6, 7, 4}, 
{10, 12, 32}, {12, 32, 10}

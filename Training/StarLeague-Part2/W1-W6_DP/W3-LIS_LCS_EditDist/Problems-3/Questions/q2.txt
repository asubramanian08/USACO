Is Bigger Smarter (Starleague Training Problem)

Some people think that the bigger a cow is, the smarter it is. To disprove this opinion, Bessie the cow collected 
the weight and IQ data of N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows to make a possible longest list of cows where the weights 
are increasing, but the IQ's are decreasing.

Help Bessie to calculate size of such a list of cows.

INPUT FORMAT

Line 2 ... N+1: Two integers w and q (1 <= w, q <= 1000) describing the weight and IQ of a cow.

OUTPUT FORMAT
An integer denoting the length of the longest sequence of cows where the size is strictly increasing and the IQ 
is strictly decreasing.

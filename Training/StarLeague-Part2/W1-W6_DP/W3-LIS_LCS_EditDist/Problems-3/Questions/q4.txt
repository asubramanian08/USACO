New Cow List (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John sometimes changes the cows' barns so that the cows can make new friends. N (1 <= N <= 1000) cows come 
to a barn and N cows in that barn go to other barns. The hardest part of this change is updating the list of cows 
on the door every time.

Instead of creating a new list every time, FJ changes the names in the existing list. He makes three different 
operations to convert a name to another:
* Deleting a letter
* Inserts a new letter
* Replacing one letter with another.

Each operations takes a certain amount of time.
What is the minimum time to update a list?

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N
Line 2 ... N+1: Each line contains two names. The first name should be converted to the second one. Names consist 
of uppercase English letters and length of the names is not more than 500 letters.
Lines N+2: Space separated three integers a, b, c (1 <= a, b, c <= 10) representing the time required to delete, 
insert or replace a letter respectively.

OUTPUT FORMAT
An integer denoting the minimum time to update the list.

SAMPLE INPUT
2
BESSIE  LESSIE
ROSIE	DOROTHY
1 2 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT
16

OUTPUT DETAILS
From BESSIE TO LESSIE: Remove 'B' insert 'L'. 1 + 2 = 3;
From ROSIE to DOROTHY: Insert "DO" 2 + 2 = 4, remove "SIE" 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and insert "THY" 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. Total 
cost is 4 + 3 + 6 = 13.

Cow Jog (USACO 2014 Dec, Gold)

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 100,000) are out exercising their hooves again, jogging along an infinite track.  Each cow starts at a distinct position on the track, and some cows run at different speeds.

The track is divided into lanes so that cows may move past each other. No two cows in the same lane may ever 
occupy the same position.  Farmer John doesn't want any cow to have to change lanes or adjust speed, and he 
wonders how many lanes he will need to accomplish this if the cows are going to run for T minutes 
(1 <= T <= 1,000,000,000).

INPUT: (file cowjog.in)
The first line of input contains N and T.

The following N lines each contain the initial position and speed of a single cow.  Position is a nonnegative 
integer and speed is a positive integer; both numbers are at most 1 billion.  All cows start at distinct 
positions, and these will be given in increasing order in the input.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 3
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 2
6 1

OUTPUT: (file cowjog.out)
A single integer indicating the minimum number of lanes necessary so that no two cows in the same lane ever 
occupy the same location (including at time T).

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3

Exercise (USACO 2020 US open, Gold)

Farmer John has come up with a new morning exercise routine for the cows (again)!

As before, Farmer John's N cows (1≤N≤10^4) are standing in a line. The i-th cow from the left has label i for 
each 1≤i≤N. He tells them to repeat the following step until the cows are in the same order as when they started.

Given a permutation A of length N, the cows change their order such that the i-th cow from the left before the 
change is Ai-th from the left after the change.

For example, if A=(1,2,3,4,5) then the cows perform one step. If A=(2,3,1,5,4), then the cows perform six steps. 
The order of the cows from left to right after each step is as follows:
0 steps: (1,2,3,4,5)
1 step: (3,1,2,5,4)
2 steps: (2,3,1,4,5)
3 steps: (1,2,3,5,4)
4 steps: (3,1,2,4,5)
5 steps: (2,3,1,5,4)
6 steps: (1,2,3,4,5)

Find the sum of all positive integers K such that there exists a permutation of length N that requires the cows 
to take exactly K steps.

As this number may be very large, output the answer modulo M (10^8≤M≤10^9+7, M is prime).

INPUT FORMAT (file exercise.in):
The first line contains N and M.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file exercise.out):
A single integer.

SAMPLE INPUT:
5 1000000007
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
21
There exist permutations that cause the cows to take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 steps. Thus, the answer is 
1+2+3+4+5+6=21.

SCORING:
Test cases 2-5 satisfy N≤10^2.
Test cases 6-10 satisfy no additional constraints.

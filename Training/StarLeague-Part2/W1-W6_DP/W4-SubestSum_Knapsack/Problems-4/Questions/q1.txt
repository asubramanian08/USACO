Cow Cash (USACO 2007 Oct, Gold)

The cows have not only created their own government but they have chosen to create their own money system. In 
their own rebellious way, they are curious about values of coinage. Traditionally, coins come in values like 1, 5, 
10, 20 or 25, 50, and 100 units, sometimes with a 2 unit coin thrown in for good measure.

The cows want to know how many different ways it is possible to dispense a certain amount of money using various 
coin systems.  For instance, using a system with values {1, 2, 5, 10, ...} it is possible to create 18 units 
several different ways, including: 18x1, 9x2, 8x2+2x1, 3x5+2+1, and many others.

Write a program to compute how many ways to construct a given amount of money N (1 <= N <= 10,000) using 
V (1 <= V <= 25) coins. It is guaranteed that the total will fit into both a signed 'long long' integer (C/C++), 
'Int64' (Pascal), and 'long' integers in Java.

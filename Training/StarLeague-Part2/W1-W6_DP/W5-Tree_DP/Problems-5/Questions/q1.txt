K-leaf Tree (Starleague Training Problem)

There is a tree structure with N (1 <= N <= 3,000) nodes. There is a weight wi (1 <= wi <= 1000) assigned to each 
node. The aim is to delete enough nodes from the tree so that the tree is left with precisely K (0 <= K <= 1000) 
leaves. 

The cost of such a deletion is the sum of the weights of the nodes deleted. After deleting some nodes, tree still 
should be connected. What is the minimum cost to reduce the given tree into a tree with K leaves?

INPUT FORMAT (file leaves.in):
Line 1: N, K and id of the root node. Nodes are conveniently numbered from 1 to N.
Line 2: Space separated N integers denoting the weights of the nodes starting from the first node.
Line 3 to N+1: Space separated two integers u and v. Node u and node v are directly connected.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file leaves.out):
An integer that is the minimum cost to leave the tree exactly with K leaves. Print "Impossible" otherwise.

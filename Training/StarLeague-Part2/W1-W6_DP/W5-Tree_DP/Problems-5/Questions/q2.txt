Christmas Tree (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John and the cows made a Christmas tree and decorated it with N (1 <= N <= 100,000) light bulbs 
conveniently numbered 1 ... N. They have some difficulty in turning on all the bulbs as the switch system is 
complex. 

There is a light bulb at the very top of the tree. This bulb is connected to some other bulbs at the lower level. 
Likewise, each bulb is connected to some other bulbs at a lower level or that connection ends in that bulb. This 
way all the bulbs are connected to each other. One bulb directly connected at most three other bulbs and there is 
always only a unique path between any two bulbs.

The cows attached a switch to each light bulb to turn the bulbs on and off. However, this switch does not only 
toggle the bulb to which it is connected, but also the other bulbs to which that bulb is directly connected.

Cows have already used some switches and now some of the bulbs are on. 

Help cows calculate at least how many times they should use switches to turn on all the bulbs?

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N
Line 2: Space separated N binary integers representing the initial states of the bulbs starting from the first 
node. 0 means the corresponding bulb is off, 1 means on.
Line 3 ... N+1: Each line describes a pair of bulbs with two integers ai and bi (1 <= ai, bi <= N and ai != bi), 
indicating that bulbs ai and bi are directly connected.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Print minimum number of switch operations to turn on all the bulbs. If it is not possible, print "Impossible".

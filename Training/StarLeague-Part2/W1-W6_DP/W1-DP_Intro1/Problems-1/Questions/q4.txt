Sister Sharing (Starleague Training Problem)

FJ leaves N (1 <= N <= 1500) hay bales in each barn to keep the cows from starving during the winter days. Hay 
bale i has a yumminess value of yi (1 <= yi <= 100) and it is written on the hay bale. Two cows stay in each barn. 

Bessie and Elsie are barn mates and they decide to share the hay bales to prevent any future issues.  Bessie and 
Elsie put the hay bales in a line. Bessie is positioned at the left end of the line and Elsie is positioned at 
the right end. To make a fair share, they will get some hay bales from their end in turn. In one turn, one cow 
gets at least 1 and at most the yumminess value of the hay bale in front. 

Help Bessie calculate maximum total yumminess she may have if she takes the first turn.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N
Line 2: N space separated integers describing yumminess values of hay bales in the line.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer denoting maximum total yumminess Bessie may obtain.

SAMPLE INPUT (file sharing.in)
10
2 4 1 3 3 5 2 1 5 2 

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file sharing.out)
13

OUTPUT DETAILS
Bessie takes 1 jay bales, Elsie takes 1 hay bales, Bessie takes 4 hay bales and finally Elsie takes remaining 4 
hay bales.

[2]  [4 1 3 3]  [5 2 1 5]  [2]
(2) + (4 + 1 + 3 + 3) = 13.

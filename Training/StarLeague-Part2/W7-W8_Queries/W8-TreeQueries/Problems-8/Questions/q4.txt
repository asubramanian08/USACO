Cow Land (USACO 2019 Feb, Gold)

Cow Land is a special amusement park for cows, where they roam around, eat delicious grass, and visit different 
cow attractions (the roller cowster is particularly popular).

There are a total of N different attractions (2≤N≤10^5). Certain pairs of attractions are connected by pathways, 
N−1 in total, in such a way that there is a unique route consisting of various pathways between any two 
attractions. Each attraction i has an integer enjoyment value ei, which can change over the course of a day, 
since some attractions are more appealing in the morning and others later in the afternoon.

A cow that travels from attraction i to attraction j gets to experience all the attractions on the route from i 
to j. Curiously, the total enjoyment value of this entire route is given by the bitwise XOR of all the enjoyment 
values along the route, including those of attractions i and j.

Please help the cows determine the enjoyment values of the routes they plan to use during their next trip to Cow 
Land.

INPUT FORMAT (file cowland.in):
The first line of input contains N and a number of queries Q (1≤Q≤10^5). The next line contains 
e1…eN (0≤ei≤10^9). The next N−1 lines each describe a pathway in terms of two integer attraction IDs a and b 
(both in the range 1…N). Finally, the last Q lines each describe either an update to one of the ei values or a 
query for the enjoyment of a route. A line of the form "1 i v" indicates that ei should be updated to value v, 
and a line of the form "2 i j" is a query for the enjoyment of the route connecting attractions i and j.

In test data worth at most 50% of points, there will be no changes to the values of the attractions.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowland.out):
For each query of the form "2 i j", print on a single line the enjoyment of the route from i to j.

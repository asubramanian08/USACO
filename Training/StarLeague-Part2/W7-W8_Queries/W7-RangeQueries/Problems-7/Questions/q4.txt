Why Did the Cow Cross the Road III (USACO 2017 Feb, Gold)

The layout of Farmer John's farm is quite peculiar, with a large circular road running around the perimeter of 
the main field on which his cows graze during the day. Every morning, the cows cross this road on their way 
towards the field, and every evening they all cross again as they leave the field and return to the barn.

As we know, cows are creatures of habit, and they each cross the road the same way every day. Each cow crosses 
into the field at a different point from where she crosses out of the field, and all of these crossing points 
are distinct from each-other. Farmer John owns N cows, conveniently identified with the integer IDs 1…N, so 
there are precisely 2N crossing points around the road. Farmer John records these crossing points concisely by 
scanning around the circle clockwise, writing down the ID of the cow for each crossing point, ultimately forming 
a sequence with 2N numbers in which each number appears exactly twice. He does not record which crossing points 
are entry points and which are exit points.

Looking at his map of crossing points, Farmer John is curious how many times various pairs of cows might cross 
paths during the day. He calls a pair of cows (a,b) a "crossing" pair if cow a's path from entry to exit must 
cross cow b's path from entry to exit. Please help Farmer John count the total number of crossing pairs.

INPUT FORMAT (file circlecross.in):
The first line of input contains N (1≤N≤50,000), and the next 2N lines describe the cow IDs for the sequence of 
entry and exit points around the field.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file circlecross.out):
Please print the total number of crossing pairs.

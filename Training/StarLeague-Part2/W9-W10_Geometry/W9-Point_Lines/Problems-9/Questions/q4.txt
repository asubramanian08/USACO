Regions (Starleague Training Problem)
The 2D space has been divided into several regions with N (0 <= N <= 100,000) lines. What is the minimum number 
of the regions you need to travel between the start point and the end point? You can only travel one of the 
adjacent regions from your current region.

INPUT FORMAT (file regions.in):
Line 1: Four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2 (-10,000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10,000). Coordinates of the start and end 
points.
Line 2: N
Line 3 to N+2: Four integers: xi, yi, xj, yj (-1000 <= xi, yi, xj, yj <= 1000). Coordinates of two points that 
represent a line. Those two points are distinct.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file regions.out):
An integer that is the minimum number of regions to travel between the start point and the end point.

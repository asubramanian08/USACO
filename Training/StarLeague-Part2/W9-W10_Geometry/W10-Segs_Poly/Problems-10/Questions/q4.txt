Partitioning the Farm 1 (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John's N barns (3 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) are all located at distinct positions in his two-dimensional field. Barns 
are conveniently numbered from 1 to N. There are Ci (1 <= Ci < 100) cows in barn i.

All barns are surrounded by a rectangular fence. Farmer John has decided to build one horizontal and one vertical 
fence to separate the barns from each other. New fences should go across the entire farm and cannot go through 
barns. After building new two fences the farm will be partition into four rectangular regions.

Help FJ to count number of cows in each region for Q (1 <= Q <= 30,000) different queries. Each query describes 
two new fences.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: Two single integers N and Q. 
Line 2 .. N+1: Three space separated integers xi, yi and ci ( 1 <= xi, yi <= 10^9) specifying the location of a 
barn and number of cows in that barn respectively. 
Line N+2 ... N + Q - 1: Two integers xi and yi ( 1 <= xi, yi <= 10^9) specifying position of the vertical and the 
horizontal fences.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Line 1 .. Q: Line i answers query i with space separated four integers A, B, C, D: A is the number of cows in the 
left-bottom rectangle, B is the number of cows in the right-bottom rectangle, C is the number of cows in upper-
right rectangle and D is the number of cows in the upper-left rectangle.

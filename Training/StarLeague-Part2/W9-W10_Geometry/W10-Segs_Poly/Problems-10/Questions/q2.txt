Building A Fence (USACO 2008 Oct, Gold)

Industrious Farmer John wants a build a four-sided fence to enclose the cows. He has one plank of wood of integer length N (4 <= N <= 2,500) that he wants to cut at three points to make four integer-length pieces.

The four pieces can be of any positive integer length as long as Farmer John can form a quadrilateral fence with 
them. How many different ways can he cut the plank of wood so that he can make a complete fence?

NOTES:
  * Two ways of cutting are different if one has a cut at a spot that the other doesn't. Don't worry about 
eliminating symmetries or other complexities like that.
  * Do make sure, though, that the fence has greater than 0 area.
  * Rejoice that the answer will always fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

PROBLEM NAME: quad

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: A single integer: N

SAMPLE INPUT:
6

INPUT DETAILS:
The plank of wood has length 6.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: A single integer that is the number of ways that Farmer John can cut the plank of wood into four pieces 
such that they form a valid quadrilateral.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
6

OUTPUT DETAILS:
Farmer John can cut the plank 10 ways into four pieces: (1, 1, 1, 3); (1, 1, 2, 2); (1, 1, 3, 1); (1, 2, 1, 2); 
(1, 2, 2, 1); (1, 3, 1, 1); (2, 1, 1, 2); (2, 1, 2, 1); (2, 2, 1, 1); or (3, 1, 1, 1).
Four of these -- (1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3, 1), (1, 3, 1, 1), and (3, 1, 1, 1) -- cannot be used to form a 
quadrilateral, though.

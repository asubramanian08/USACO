City Horizon (USACO 2007 April, Silver)

Farmer John has taken his cows on a trip to the city! As the sun sets, the cows gaze at the city horizon and 
observe the beautiful silhouettes formed by the rectangular buildings.

The entire horizon is represented by a number line with N (1 <= N <= 40,000) buildings. Building i's silhouette 
has a base that spans locations A_i through B_i along the horizon (1 <= A_i < B_i <= 1,000,000,000) and has height 
H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000,000,000). Determine the area, in square units, of the aggregate silhouette formed by all N 
buildings.

PROBLEM NAME: horizon

INPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: A single integer: N
* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes building i with three space-separated integers: A_i, B_i, and H_i

SAMPLE INPUT (file horizon.in):
4
2 5 1
9 10 4
6 8 2
4 6 3


OUTPUT FORMAT:
* Line 1: The total area, in square units, of the silhouettes formed by all N buildings

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file horizon.out):
16

OUTPUT DETAILS:
The first building overlaps with the fourth building for an area of 1 square unit, so the total area is just 3*1 
+ 1*4 + 2*2 + 2*3 - 1 = 16.

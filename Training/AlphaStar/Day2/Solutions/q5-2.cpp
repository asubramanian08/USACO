/*Lewin Ganâ€™s explanation:

It's easiest to view this as a knapsack problem, but we need to find out what our items are.

For any arbitrary tile, let us construct a set of possible weight/cost pairs that we can add into the 
knapsack. We notice that a tile can have value up to at most sqrt(M), since any more than that will go 
over M, so we just construct the set for a tile as { (i*i,(i-tile)^2 }, where i ranges from 1 to sqrt(M), 
and tile is the tile value.

We need to add exactly one item from each set such that the weights add up to M and the costs are minimized.

The way to do this is dynamic programming. Let cost[i][j] denote the item in the set with weight i*i and 
cost (i-tile[j])^2. Then, let dp[i][j] denote the minimum cost to get tiles with weights that sum up to i 
but we only use the first j tiles. The recurrence for dp[i][j] is then dp[i][j] = 
min(dp[i- k*k][j- 1]+cost[k][j-1]), since we need to choose exactly one tile from this set. Iterating 
through this dp-table will take O(N*M^3/2), which will run in time

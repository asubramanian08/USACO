Cow Digit Game
==============

Bessie is playing a number game against Farmer John, and she wants
you to help her achieve victory.

Game i starts with an integer N_i (1 <= N_i <= 1,000,000). Bessie
goes first, and then the two players alternate turns. On each turn,
a player can subtract either the largest digit or the smallest
non-zero digit from the current number to obtain a new number. For
example, from 3014 we may subtract either 1 or 4 to obtain either
3013 or 3010, respectively. The game continues until the number
becomes 0, at which point the last player to have taken a turn is
the winner.

Bessie and FJ play G (1 <= G <= 100) games. Determine, for each
game, whether Bessie or FJ will win, assuming that both play perfectly
(that is, on each turn, if the current player has a move that will
guarantee his or her win, he or she will take it).

Consider a sample game where N_i = 13. Bessie goes first and takes
3, leaving 10. FJ is forced to take 1, leaving 9. Bessie takes the
remainder and wins the game.

PROBLEM NAME: cdgame

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: G

* Lines 2..G+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer: N_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

2
9
10

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..G: Line i contains "YES" if Bessie can win game i, and "NO"
        otherwise.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

YES
NO

OUTPUT DETAILS:

For the first game, Bessie simply takes the number 9 and wins.
For the second game, Bessie must take 1 (since she cannot take 0), and then
FJ can win by taking 9.

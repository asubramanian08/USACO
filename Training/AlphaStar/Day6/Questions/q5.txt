Cow Frisbee Team
================

After Farmer Don took up Frisbee, Farmer John wanted to join in the
fun. He wants to form a Frisbee team from his N cows (1 <= N <=
2,000) conveniently numbered 1..N. The cows have been practicing
flipping the discs around, and each cow i has a rating R_i (1 <=
R_i <= 100,000) denoting her skill playing Frisbee. FJ can form a
team by choosing one or more of his cows.

However, because FJ needs to be very selective when forming Frisbee
teams, he has added an additional constraint. Since his favorite
number is F (1 <= F <= 1,000), he will only accept a team if the
sum of the ratings of each cow in the team is exactly divisible by
F.

Help FJ find out how many different teams he can choose. Since this
number can be very large, output the answer modulo 100,000,000.

Note: about 50% of the test data will have N <= 19.

PROBLEM NAME: fristeam

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and F

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: R_i

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 5
1
2
8
2

INPUT DETAILS:

FJ has four cows whose ratings are 1, 2, 8, and 2. He will only accept a
team whose rating sum is a multiple of 5.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the number of teams FJ can
        choose, modulo 100,000,000.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can pair the 8 and either of the 2's (8 + 2 = 10), or he can use both
2's and the 1 (2 + 2 + 1 = 5).

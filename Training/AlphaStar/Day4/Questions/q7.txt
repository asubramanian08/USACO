Enjoying a casual afternoon walk in the coordinate system,little Luka has encountered N unique circles 
with its centers lying on the x-axis. The circles do not intersect, but they can touch (from the inside 
and the outside). Fascinated with circles, Luka wondered how many regions the circles divide the plane 
into. Of course, you are going to help him answer this question.

A region is a set of points such that each two points can be connected with a continuous curve, without 
cutting through any of the circles.

Look at q7-Image.png

INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains the integer N (1 <= N <= 300,000), the number of circles. Each of the 
following N lines contains two integers Xi and Ri (-10^9 <= Xi <= 10^9, 1 <= Ri <= 10^9) the number Xi 
representing the x coordinate of the ith circle and the number Ri representing the radius of the ith circle.

All the circles in the input will be unique.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the task.

Scoring in test cases worth 40% of total points, the N will not exceed 5,000.

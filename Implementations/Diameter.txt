The diameter of a tree is the longest path in the tree

Use a DynamicLCA to find the distance
https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/blob/master/Implementations/LCA/DynamicLCA.cpp

Properties:
1.  There can be multiple diameters
2.  The longest distance from any node = max of dists from that node to the diameters
3.  When a new node is added the new diameter contains one of the old diameter nodes
